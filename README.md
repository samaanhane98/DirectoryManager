```

## Add Cron

On Arch, using cronie

```
crontab -e
```

Cron

```cron
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/directory-manager
```

## Usage

Add directories you want to manage to the program its Config.toml as follows:

```toml
[directories.${NAME}]
config = ${PATH TO DIRECTORY CONFIG}
```

Add the following to a config.toml in the managed directory:

```
[extensions]
pdf = "PDF"
png = "Images"
```

This will move a file ending in the extension to the corresponding directory. If the directory does not exist the program creates it first.
